    "\n",
    "> Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc. The normal identifying process is that patients need to visit a diagnostic center, consult their doctor, and sit tight for a day or more to get their reports. So, the objective of this project is to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements.. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "> About Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Pregnancies: No. of times pregnant\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Glucose: Plasma Glucose Concentration (mg/dl)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Blood Pressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure(mmHg)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Skin Thickness:A value used to estimate body fat. Normal Triceps SkinFold Thickness in women is 23mm. Higher thickness leads to obesity and chances of diabetes increases.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Age:Age (years)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient is not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes."
